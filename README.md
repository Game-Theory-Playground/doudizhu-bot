# Doudizhu Bot

Bot for playing Doudizhu


## Setup
1. Start a python virtual environment in this directory:

    ```bash
    # Linux/Mac:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  
    
    # Windows:
    python3 -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    If this windows command doesn't work, you may have to run this in an Admin shell first:
    ```powershell
    set-executionpolicy remotesigned
    ```

3. Next, install all the python requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Running

Note: if your venv has become deactivated, you may need to reactivate it with the activate command in the Setup section.
